# BinaryHeap

Simple implementation of a <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tcortina/15-121sp10/Unit06B.pdf" target="_blank">min-heap</a> using a vector in C++.

## Motivation

To review old algorithms and re-familiarize self with C++.

## Notes

The `binary_heap` interface is dissimilar but based on UVA Professor Aaron Bloomfield's interface. See https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/slides/code/10-heaps-huffman/binary_heap.h.html. The implementation was done by self.

I'll probably use this code to re-implement Huffman encoding/decoding, if I feel like it... 

## Testing

`make binary_heap_test` to build.

`./builds/BinaryHeapTest` to execute tests.
