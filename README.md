# BinaryHeap

Simple implementation of a min-heap using a vector in C++.

## Motivation

To review old algorithms and re-familiarize self with C++.

## Notes

The `binary_heap` interface is dissimilar but based on Professor Bloomfield's interface. The implementation was done by self.

I'll probably use this code to re-implement Huffman encoding/decoding, if I feel like it... 

## Testing

`make binary_heap_test` to build.

`./builds/BinaryHeapTest` to execute tests.
